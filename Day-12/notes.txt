Authentication :- 

        1. Signup :- create-Account/ register
            email :
            password :
                store to DB

        2. Login :- 
            email :
            password :
                email&&password is correct ? login successfull : login failed;

            /purchased


            a. we will make the login at every protect points.
                1. you are annoying the user/not the right user experience
                2. not a optional way, quering db's users collection again and again

            b. token
                when someone login in successfully, we gave them a token name "abc123"
                we'll check the token when they visit the protected endpoints
                if token is correct? "give that endpoint access":"login again"
